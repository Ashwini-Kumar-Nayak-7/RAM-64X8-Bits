A RAM is Random Access Memory, A memory unit is a device to which binary information is transferred for storage and from which information is retrieved for processing. RAM stores new information for later use. It can perform both read and write operations.

In VERILOG, memory is designed as an array of registers using a reg keyword. The first number in the array specifies the number of bits in a word and the second gives the number of words in the memory.
